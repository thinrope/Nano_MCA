2012-10-10	Nano_MCA-0.12.1 released
===============================================================
Summary:
--------
This is the first release based on the new git repo:
	https://github.com/thinrope/Nano_MCA

There are almost no changes to the code from the previous GGV2-0.12, but a lot
of cleanup and a new build system. I decided to rename the project to Nano_MCA
to show better its purpose and to be easy to find in search engines (than
GGV2). I will try to set some time to improve the code, but anybody, please
feel free to submit any bug/issues or requests/features directly on the github
Issue tracker. And of course feel incouraged to fork!

Most important commits:
-----------------------
[6f41148] bug: wrong order of defines? doesn't compile, fixing.
[dac2080] Adding top-level Makefile
[a05631d] Adding dynamic VERSION and BUILD_DATE
[e5db3a8] merging tools/make_dfu.sh into `make release`
[7b10fd8] moving all libraries to lib/
[5b1478f] Initial import from GGV2_0.12.zip
